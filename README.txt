My EVE Online Mining Bot
========================

A simple bot to mine ore in EVE Online game, that I created long ago to ease the boredom of mining, while keeping the profitability of this in-game occupation at the same time.
It's based on provided time calculations for actions, emulates player's actions and requires the right prior setup of in-game windows.
Allows to cycle the use of asteroid belts and use profiles, to remember the setting for different solar systems.

It's here for historical reasons. Probably won't work now, however I used it for quite some time, before I got finally banned. Which was of course just and expected - "I fought the law and the law won". :)
